    "\n",
    "This demo uses the IfcOpenShell [IfcOpenShell](https://ifcopenshell.org/), a powerful toolkit to interact with IFC files and follows some instructions of [https://thinkmoult.com/using-ifcopenshell-parse-ifc-files-python.html](https://thinkmoult.com/using-ifcopenshell-parse-ifc-files-python.html). \n",

    "There are multiple ways to use IfcOpenShell and manage dependencies, see [IfcOpenShell_Installation](https://blenderbim.org/docs-python/ifcopenshell-python/installation.html). For using it with Anaconda, the `environment.yml` file is provided in this repository. Anyway, feel free to use whatever installation method suits you best. \n",

Technically, the opening element causes the void in the parent element (wall, slab, ...).
